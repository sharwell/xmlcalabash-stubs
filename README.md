## XML Calabash Extension Stubs

This artifact contains stub classes for several closed-source libraries for which XML Calabash offers some level of support. These stubs allow users to *compile* XML Calabash from source without licensing these products separately. All methods in this artifact throw `UnsupportedOperationException`; to *use* these products within XML Calabash, they will need to be licensed and the proper binaries made available through the classpath.
